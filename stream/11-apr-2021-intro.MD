## Ez2On Reboot: R Early Access Roadmap
### Early Access and Release schedule adjustments
	> Due to the delay in game stabilization, early access schedules and plans were inevitably adjusted. So will full release schedules.	

### Additional Contents during Early Access
	> Next week, we plan to gradually update various songs starting with the popular arcade series'ルゼ-「picking」, RiraN-「Daydream」.

	> A total of 20 new song contents will be updated during the Early Access period. Also, a new DLC will be released in September.

### Usage of 'Generic BGA'
	> The team cares about the visual aspects of the game, but BGA should not be the limitating factor for releasing new songs. 

	> After serious considerations, the team concluded that generic/simple BGA will only be used when applicable. 

### Remastering BGAs
There are currently 2 ways to remaster BGA
1. The slow and expensive way
2. The fast and easy way
	
	> Currently, about 50 percent (about 100) of entire BGAs were remastered using the first method.
	
	> Our long-term goal is to rework the remaining 50% (the screen recording ones) using the slow and expensive way. 

	> But some technical constraints make it almost impossible to work with the raw assets. Therefore, about 90 percent of the rest (remaining 95++) will be reworked if everything goes smoothly.

### My take Early Access Roadmap
Fantastic work in prioritizing what needs to be done to maintain traction, while having the courage and faith in the community to adjust the release schedules!
