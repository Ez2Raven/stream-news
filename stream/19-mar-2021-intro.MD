## Agenda
### What is included
* Sales, marketing and early access issues
* Laser focused for players who have not played other EZ Franchises but games like Beatmania and DJMAX

### Out of scope
* Exclude additional songs, potential collaborations, Ez2AC as DLCs, copyright issues.
* Unsupported Operating System. (Windows 7 & below, Linux)

## Early Access issues
* The cause of the freeze during loading has been identified and is currently going through tesrting.
* Most of the issues that are happening now are due to the servers being overloaded by players.
* Preview video quality is poor when selecting a song is by design, in order to support low-spec systems.
* They will fix infinite loading screen problem very soon but it may not be fixed in this update
* They're still working on audio buffer issues. Latency has been reduced multiple times during this early access period
* Server expansion has taken place multiple times throughout early access period. 

## Game Play Updates
* Real-time double speed control currently also available for F1, F2, (not saved)
  >  After song is selected, you can increase/decrease speed using F1 and F2 keys
* Non-stop remix will be deleted due to policy and will be updated in a different format
* Judgment/Gage becomes difficult after update: The task of moving the decision line + the task of making the decision difficult
   > Making the judgement harder because there's many korean players getting all KOOL.
   >
   > In short, lowering the bell curve for scoring.
  
* Standard pattern release plan that is more difficult than 20 X
    > I interpret this as releasing songs that are higher than Lv 20 in difficult.
    > They can't possibly make "Be my Baby" 20x more difficult could they?
    
* BGA appreciation mode is planned, applied after official release
    > Similar to DJMAX Respect V: Music Video Playback.
    
* Regarding random and other effects like fade in/out will be implemented eventually.
* Size of notes is currently 1.5x bigger than previous EZ2ON releases, it is still under consideration since it is a subjective opinion. 
* Multiplayer is being reviewed among 7-9 players.
* Sudden Death (existing song) will be added
* There is no plan yet for additional modes such as Easy To Catch.

## Misc Updates
* They are considering to completely review the early access period but this requires discussion with company
* Reason for donating: As recommended by the sales side
   > Most likely related to game developer / marketing team donating to streamers.
* When the roadmap is stabilized, it will be prepared and published. 
* No plans to "release" the controller.
* OST will be decided after early access and after discussing with company
* Overseas purchases are very low because they are often purchased by looking at the Steam evaluation
* There will be no in-game goods
* Game streaming is free
* There are currently no plans to make EZ2ON available on cloud gaming platforms such as 'GeForce Now'.
