## Introduction

* Started playing EZ2DJ 1st Edition back in Year 2000. (20 years! Nandeyanen!)
* And throughout those years I have picked up the 3:5 semi-static hand position. 
> Shows 2(3):5 hand positions. 
> 
>Right hand fatigue.

## Problem statement

21 years later, music rhythm games have been ported to PC platform.

And today we have famous games such as DJMAX, Mush dash and 
now EZ2ON Reboot:R 

However, most of the chart patterns are designed for keyboard players.

AND due to the EzMax Controller layout and my 3/3 hand technique.

I get fatigued in my fingers very quickly on difficult songs.

## My Solution to the problem.
Ignore what is mentioned on the internet
and explore what feels nature to my hands.

> Shows new hand position.

We're gonna try this new hand position and retrain our muscle memory.

Starting from the easiest song in 8K mode.
