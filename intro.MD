# Introduction
Today we're gonna prepare a series of music to listen to while working out in the gym to LOSE FAT!

Let's calculate my maximum heart rate!
```
Fat-Burning Heart BPM = 0.7 * (220 - Age)
```

```
EZ2Raven: 128.8 BPM
```

To motivate ourselves to stay in the fat burning BPM, 
we're gonna pick songs that stays around 128 - 132 BPM.
